A search UI that pulls in live concert recordings from archive.org's API.

Features include a custom JavaScript music player, ability to make playlists that persist across browser sessions and access to thousands of live concert recordings.

App also features a custom visualizer made by connecting to the browser's audio api and using D3.js to dynamically display a visual representation of the frequency of the sound waves for whichever song is playing.

The front end is built in ReactJS with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The back end is built in ExpressJS, a Node based JavaScript framework.
